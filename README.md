This repository is created as a train/learning method. All the content present here is the representation of my thoughts about how a software should be developed.

I needed a project, so I decided to use one of the projects from the Master’s Degree.

# Introduction
This project is developed in two parts. The first one is in a monolith architecture with almost all functionalities. In the second part, the monolith is migrated to a microservice architecture and added remaining functionalities.

During all development, all the practices that I consider the best practices of software engineering are used.

# Project statements
* [**Statement 1**](./docs/statement_1.md): Monolith
* **Statement 2**: Microservice (in progress)
