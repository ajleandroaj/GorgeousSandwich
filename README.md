This repository is created as a train/learning method. All the content present here is the representation of my thoughts
about how a software should be developed.

I needed a project, so I decided to use one of the projects from the Masterâ€™s Degree.

# Introduction

This project is developed in two parts. The first one is in a monolith architecture with almost all functionalities. In
the second part, the monolith is migrated to a microservice architecture and added remaining functionalities.

During all development, all the practices that I consider the best practices of software engineering are used.

# Project statements

* [**Statement 1**](docs/statements/statement_1.md): Monolith
* [**Statement 2**](docs/statements/statement_2.md): Microservice

# Analysis and requirements

## Domain model

All the components in the domain model diagram as created based at [Statement 1](docs/statements/statement_1.md#21-more-possible-architectural-drivers). The
names and properties were named respecting the Ubiquitous Language.
